Styles Reading:

When using inline styles with JSX property names must be camel cased when used with objects.
also values like "12px" must be a string.
My prefered method is using CSS Modules
import styles from './Component.module.css';

Iterating With Map:

map() will pass each element from the arry one at a time
example given: 
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const newNums = nums.map( (num) => {
    return num * 2;
} );

console.log( newNums ); // logs [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

"In general, you can use the map method whenever
you want to transform each element of an array according to a function."

map creates a new array, will not change the original array.
another example:
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

function double(num) {
    return num * 2;
}

const newNums = nums.map( double );

console.log( newNums ); // logs [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]



Lecture: briefly went over last weeks material with map() & Lifting State
8:41: Lifting with State
idx is a unqiue identifier 
"siblings" cannot pass data to each other, data flows down, you must lift state up to the
'parent' and then pass it down to the child
